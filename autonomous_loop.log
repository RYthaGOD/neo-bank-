Here's what occurred during execution:

1. **Failed to Edit Rust Program**: The exact text needed for replacement wasn't found. I will need more precise details to make the edit.

2. **Anchor Command Not Found**: It seems the `anchor` tool isn't installed or accessible. We'll need to install it or add it to the PATH.

3. **Failed to Push Code to GitHub**: The command was executed but failed due to authentication issues with GitHub. I will need the proper credentials or access setup.

Would you like to proceed with addressing these issues, or do you have any adjustments to the tasks?
