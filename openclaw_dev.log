[Wed Feb  4 22:07:20 AWST 2026] Launching OpenClaw agent with enhanced capabilities...

Here's the situation based on the security audit and handoff documents:

### What We've Achieved
- **Security Audit Passed:** 9.2/10 rating. Our systems are production-ready with minor improvements.
- **AgentShield CPI Integration:** On-chain validation is ready but requires the actual program ID.
- **Circuit Breaker and BlockScore Integration:** Fully operational.

### Key Task Assignments
1. **Forum Monitoring (High Priority):** 
   - Track discussions on AgentShield and security practices.
   - Engage and share our security features with the community.

2. **AgentShield Integration (High Priority):**
   - Awaiting the actual program ID from the AgentShield team.
   - Update code once the ID is obtained.

3. **Community Announcement (Medium Priority):**
   - Prepare to announce our multi-layer security once the devnet deployment is successful.

4. **Improve Code (Medium Priority):**
   - Implement recommended improvements such as adding heuristics and fail-safes.

5. **Documentation (Low Priority):**
   - Update the README with new security features and write deployment guides.

6. **Competitive Intelligence (Low Priority):**
   - Track security features in other hackathon projects.

### Immediate Actions
- **Monitor forums** for updates on the AgentShield program ID.
- **Begin code improvements** as outlined in the recommendations.
- **Engage with the community** and prepare an announcement alongside a security configuration guide.

### Next Steps
Would you like me to start monitoring the relevant forums for updates or begin with a specific task from the list above?
